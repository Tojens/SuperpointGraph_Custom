## We are recruting! A PhD student for an extension of SPG to 4D data, see the [proposal](http://recherche.ign.fr/llandrieu/PhD_proposal_READY3D.pdf).


## Code structure
* `./partition/*` - Partition code (geometric partitioning and superpoint graph construction using handcrafted features)
* `./supervized_partition/*` - Supervized partition code (partitioning with learned features)
* `./learning/*` - Learning code (superpoint embedding and contextual segmentation).

To switch to the stable branch with only SPG, switch to [release](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph/tree/release).

## Disclaimer
Our partition method is inherently stochastic. Hence, even if we provide the trained weights, it is possible that the results that you obtain differ slightly from the ones presented in the paper.

## Requirements 
*0.* Download current version of the repository. We recommend using the `--recurse-submodules` option to make sure the [cut pursuit](https://github.com/loicland/cut-pursuit) module used in `/partition` is downloaded in the process. Wether you did not used the following command, please, refer to point 4: <br>
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph
```

*1.* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [torchnet](https://github.com/pytorch/tnt).
```
pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/tnt.git@master
``` 

*2.* Install additional Python packages:
```
pip install future python-igraph tqdm transforms3d pynvrtc fastrlock cupy h5py sklearn plyfile scipy
```

*3.* Install Boost (1.63.0 or newer) and Eigen3, in Conda:<br>
```
conda install -c anaconda boost; conda install -c omnia eigen3; conda install eigen; conda install -c r libiconv
```

*4.* Make sure that cut pursuit was downloaded. Otherwise, clone [this repository](https://github.com/loicland/cut-pursuit) or add it as a submodule in `/partition`: <br>
```
cd partition
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote cut-pursuit
```

*5.* Compile the ```libply_c``` and ```libcp``` libraries:
```
CONDAENV=YOUR_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT_LOCATION
cd partition/ply_c
cmake . -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$CONDAENV/lib/libpython3.6m.so -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDAENV/include/python3.6m -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=$CONDAENV/include -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDAENV/include/eigen3
make
cd ..
cd cut-pursuit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$CONDAENV/lib/libpython3.6m.so -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDAENV/include/python3.6m -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=$CONDAENV/include -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDAENV/include/eigen3
make
```
*6.* (optional) Install [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric)

The code was tested on Ubuntu 14 and 16 with Python 3.5 to 3.8 and PyTorch 0.2 to 1.3.

### Troubleshooting

Common sources of errors and how to fix them:
- $CONDAENV is not well defined : define it or replace $CONDAENV by the absolute path of your conda environment (find it with ```locate anaconda```)
- anaconda uses a different version of python than 3.6m : adapt it in the command. Find which version of python conda is using with ```locate anaconda3/lib/libpython```
- you are using boost 1.62 or older: update it
- cut pursuit did not download: manually clone it in the ```partition``` folder or add it as a submodule as proposed in the requirements, point 4.
- error in make: `'numpy/ndarrayobject.h' file not found`: set symbolic link to python site-package with `sudo ln -s $CONDAENV/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy $CONDAENV/include/numpy`


## Running the code

To run our code or retrain from scratch on different datasets, see the corresponding readme files.
Currently supported dataset are as follow:

| Dataset    | handcrafted partition | learned partition | 
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------|
| S3DIS      |  yes                  | yes               |
| Semantic3D |  yes                  | to come soon      |
| vKITTI3D   |  no                   | yes               |
| ScanNet    |  to come soon         | to come soon      |

To use pytorch-geometric graph convolutions instead of our own, use the option `--use_pyg 1` in `./learning/main.py`. Their code is more stable and just as fast. Otherwise, use `--use_pyg 0` 

#### Evaluation

To evaluate quantitatively a trained model, use (for S3DIS and vKITTI3D only): 
```
python learning/evaluate.py --dataset s3dis --odir results/s3dis/best --cvfold 123456
``` 

To visualize the results and all intermediary steps, use the visualize function in partition (for S3DIS, vKITTI3D,a nd Semantic3D). For example:
```
python partition/visualize.py --dataset s3dis --ROOT_PATH $S3DIR_DIR --res_file results/s3dis/pretrained/cv1/predictions_test --file_path Area_1/conferenceRoom_1 --output_type igfpres
```

```output_type``` defined as such:
- ```'i'``` = input rgb point cloud
- ```'g'``` = ground truth (if available), with the predefined class to color mapping
- ```'f'``` = geometric feature with color code: red = linearity, green = planarity, blue = verticality
- ```'p'``` = partition, with a random color for each superpoint
- ```'r'``` = result cloud, with the predefined class to color mapping
- ```'e'``` = error cloud, with green/red hue for correct/faulty prediction 
- ```'s'``` = superedge structure of the superpoint (toggle wireframe on meshlab to view it)

Add option ```--upsample 1``` if you want the prediction file to be on the original, unpruned data (long).

# Other data sets

You can apply SPG on your own data set with minimal changes:
- adapt references to ```custom_dataset``` in ```/partition/partition.py```
- you will need to create the function ```read_custom_format``` in ```/partition/provider.py``` which outputs xyz and rgb values, as well as semantic labels if available (already implemented for ply and las files)
- adapt the template function ```/learning/custom_dataset.py``` to your achitecture and design choices
- adapt references to ```custom_dataset``` in ```/learning/main.py```
- add your data set colormap to ```get_color_from_label``` in ```/partition/provider.py```
- adapt line 212 of `learning/spg.py` to reflect the missing or extra point features
- change ```--model_config``` to ```gru_10,f_K``` with ```K``` as the number of classes in your dataset, or ```gru_10_0,f_K``` to use matrix edge filters instead of vectors (only use matrices when your data set is quite large, and with many different point clouds, like S3DIS).

# Datasets without RGB
If your data does not have RGB values you can easily use SPG. You will need to follow the instructions in ```partition/partition.ply``` regarding the pruning.
You will need to adapt the ```/learning/custom_dataset.py``` file so that it does not refer ro RGB values.
You should absolutely not use a model pretrained on values with RGB. instead, retrain a model from scratch using the ```--pc_attribs xyzelpsv``` option to remove RGB from the shape embedding input.
